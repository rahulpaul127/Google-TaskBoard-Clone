## About Me In This Project
<p align="center">
  Last year, I started learning web development. Initially, I found HTML and CSS quite easy and fascinating. I created a Netflix clone <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rahulpaul127/NETFLIX-Clone">Netflix Clone Repository</a> which boosted my confidence and made me feel comfortable with coding.

After that, I delved into JavaScript. Everything was going well, and I was excited about creating a project. I started by making small games and projects like Snake, Water And Gun, Guess the Number and Digital Clock etc (you can see everything on <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/@rahulpaul127">My Replit Account</a>
.

Feeling confident, I decided to tackle a larger JavaScript project. I thought everyone makes a to-do list, so I wanted to do something different and chose to make a Google Tasksboard clone. However, once I started, I quickly realized it wasn't as straightforward as I thought. Since I couldn't commit full-time to coding, I could only devote a little time every day. The more I worked on it, the more I understood that this was a much bigger project than I could handle at the moment. It became clear that I needed more time and practice with smaller projects to build up to something larger.

In retrospect, I realize it might have been a mistake to dive into such a complex project right away. However, I've learned a lot from this experience, and I'm determined to try again in the future when my skills have grown and I've put in more hard work and practice.
